# data_collected_for_final_year_project
Accelerometer data was self-collected from 11 male gym trainees from a local gym, “Gemstone Gym”, located in Satellite town, Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Each individual’s consent was aquired, and during their bicep routines, they were courteous enough to allow recording of their corresponding bicep movement data.
